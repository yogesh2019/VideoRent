in this section we are going to add forms
that will help us add and edit customer and movies

to create a form that add customer we need an action

this action should return a view that includes the form


under customerContoller

mvcaction4 tab

now since view is red

here as we dont have this view

so we will go and create a view

create a non partial view and layout is selected

lets change the title to new customer

now to render a form we are gonna use html helper method

like action link

@Html.BeginForm("<action_name>","<Controller_name>")

this action name is red as we didn't declare

now how to render the closing tag


@using( Html.BeginForm("Create","Customer")){

now here we need to follow some specific markup that bootstrap understands

<div class="form-group">
we can use label or write @Html.LabelFor()

and in this we specify a lambda expression that gives us the name of of the target property of the model used in this form


so let set the model


@model Video.Model.Customer

we can use label or write @Html.LabelFor(m => m.Name)

so this will take a property as value for our html label

again we can use text box 

or we can use

@Html.TextBoxFor(m => m.Name)


now if we run this we have some pre properties for this tag

for ex

data-val

we need data validation for this field

so this validtion is coming from our model
required length

now as a second argument we can pass
@Html.LabelFor(m => m.Name)
@Html.TextBoxFor(m => m.Name , new { @class = "form-control"})

</div>

<div formgroup>

@Html.LabelFor(m => m.BirthDate)
@Html.TextBoxFor(m => m.BirthDate , new { @class = "form-control"})
<div>

<div formgroup>

@Html.LabelFor(m => m.IsSubscribedToNewsLetter)
@Html.CheckBoxFor(m => m.BirthDate , new { @class = "form-control"})
<div>


we can look for the bootstrap for check box on bootstrap site

css >> form


div class= "checkbox"
label
@html.CheckBoxFor(m => m.IsSubtonews) some text


}
