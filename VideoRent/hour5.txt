you will see both server side and client side validation
we will see forgery requests and how we can prevent them in our form

mvc also uses data validation annotation to validate action parameters

so Save first while getting properties from request it checks there only if they are acc to annotations

here we can use ModelState.
to get access to validation data

ModelState.idValid

this we can use to change the application flow

if(!ModelState.isValid){

this viewModel we will initialize with whatever data user is setting to customer
	return View("CustomerForm", viewModel)
}

2nd step is to add annotation

3rd step is to add validation messages

we need to add a place holder to add validation message


@html.ValidationMessageFor(m => m.Customer.Name)

this field is required

but this is not red next i will show you how to get this as red
