now we are going to get our data from  db using entity framework

entity framework is a tool we use to access the db

more accurately its classified as orm


in old days we had to do this mapping manually which involved opening a connection to db

with orm we work at a higher level abstraction


it provides a class called dbContext	

dbContext has one or more dbSet 's which represents tables in our db	

we use linq to query these db sets

and entity framework will translate our linq queries to sql at run time

it opens the db maps the data


there are two ways to use entity framwork

db first and code first

***************** dbFirst workflow

in this we generate the corresponding domain classes after creation of database tables



***************** the other way is to create domain classes first and let the entity framework create the db tables for us


i personally favor code first to db first

increased productivity

full versioning of db using migrations

much easier to build an integration test db		

myth :
1 code first work flow on legacy db can be used very efficiently
2 it gives you full control over db
