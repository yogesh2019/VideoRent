********* intro
restful webservices using asp.net webapi
we will talk about DTO 

*************** what is Web ApI

quick view of asp.net mvc architecture

when a request arrives 
mvc framework handles that request to an action in controller  

this action most of the times returns a view

which is then parsed by RazorViewEngine

then html markup is generated on the server
and then returned to the client

now instead of return markup data

they can also return data

one benefit is
* sending raw data requires less rescources
* raw data requires less bandwidth

so data arrives faster at client
* we can build a broad range of client

these apps simply call our endpoints

get the data and generate the view locally

We call this endpoint
Dataservices or Web API
because they just return data and not markup

these are not just for our mobile and web apps

they can be consumed by other websites as well

for ex twitter,etc 

expose public services which we can consume in our websites

we can have services not only to get data 

but also modifying like adding a customer


the framework we use is 
Asp.net Web Api


.net core uses both asp.net and asp.net web api

we will be building some app using jquery

**********************************RestFul Convention

we will be building CRUD for customers

end point 
/api/customer

and we are going to support few different types of requests

get 
get 
post
put
delete

so what you see here is

in terms of request types and endpoints is a standard convention referred to as REST full convenction
